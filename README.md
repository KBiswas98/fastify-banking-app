### Fastify app to fetch banking data.

## Question

```You need to create a REST service that can fetch bank details, using the data given in the APIâ€™s query parameters.

You can use the data available in this repository (https://github.com/snarayanank2/indian_banks) in your backend db. Write your service in any language of your choice. Host it in Heroku - you can signup for a free account in Heroku. E.g. Here are steps on how you can get a django app running in Heroku in a few minutes. Please use PostgreSQL as your backend DB. You may not be able to load the entire dataset in the free tier - you can make do with 10000 rows.

Essentials your applications should have: 
use PostgreSQL as a backend database
GET API to fetch a bank details, given branch IFSC code
GET API to fetch all details of branches, given bank name and a city. This API should also support limit and offset parameters
APIs should be authenticated using a JWT key, with validity = 5 days

Deliverables: 
Hosting URL 
Github repo link to your solution
[ IMPORTANT ] Please include a curl script that makes a call to each of the above mentioned APIs(which includes the JWT key) in your repo while demonstrating the limit and offset parameters
